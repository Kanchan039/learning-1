I am a beginner, so I am learning to use GitHub.
So I am starting with uploading my numerical codes, which we use in our class work.
So far, I have uploaded code for solving Linear system of equation with the help of Newton Raphson Method.
Secondly, I have uploaded code for LU Decomposition of a matrix.
